```

## Archive Service Integration

The extension submits URLs to archive services using their form submission endpoints:

```javascript
const archiveSubmitUrl = `${archiveServiceUrl}?url=${encodeURIComponent(cleanedUrl)}`;
```

This mimics the archive service form submission process while providing seamless integration through the browser context menu.

## Auto-Archiving Features

The extension includes automatic page archiving capabilities:

- **Text Indicators**: Configure patterns to search for in page content (supports regex)
- **URL Patterns**: Define which pages to scan based on URL patterns
- **Global Scanning**: Option to scan all visited websites regardless of URL patterns
- **Smart Matching**: Supports both simple text matching and regex patterns

When enabled, the content script scans pages for configured indicators and automatically archives matching pages.

## Related Projects

This extension is similar to [rahiel/archiveror](https://github.com/rahiel/archiveror), which provides broader archiving functionality including multiple services (archive.is, archive.org, perma.cc, webcitation.org) and bookmark automation. Archiveror offers more comprehensive features like local MHTML saving and automatic bookmark archiving, while agentic-archive.is-ifier focuses specifically on archive.is-style services with a streamlined context menu experience.
