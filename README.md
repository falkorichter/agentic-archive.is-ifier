## Archive Service Integration

The extension submits URLs to archive services using their form submission endpoints:

```javascript
const archiveSubmitUrl = `${archiveServiceUrl}?url=${encodeURIComponent(cleanedUrl)}`;
```

This mimics the archive service form submission process while providing seamless integration through the browser context menu.

## Related Projects

This extension is similar to [rahiel/archiveror](https://github.com/rahiel/archiveror), which provides broader archiving functionality including multiple services (archive.is, archive.org, perma.cc, webcitation.org) and bookmark automation. Archiveror offers more comprehensive features like local MHTML saving and automatic bookmark archiving, while agentic-archive.is-ifier focuses specifically on archive.is-style services with a streamlined context menu experience.

## Development

### Testing
Run the test suite by opening `tests/test.html` in your browser. Tests cover:
- URL cleaning and validation
- Archive URL detection and extraction  
- Context menu functionality
- Complete archiving workflows

**Future Enhancement**: Consider integrating Playwright into the CI pipeline to enable automated browser testing of the popup interface and ensure UI functionality doesn't break with future changes. This would provide visual regression testing and automated screenshot capture for documentation updates.

### Contributing
When contributing:
1. Update the README with new features
2. Write tests for new functionality  
3. Check for external code changes before submitting
4. Document the LLM and tools used in development
5. **Update screenshots** - When UI changes are made, update screenshots in the README using browser testing tools like Playwright to ensure documentation stays current
